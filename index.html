            <b>Pythagoras</b> of <b>Samos</b> <b>(Ancient Greek: Πυθαγόρας; c. 570 - c. 495 BC)</b> was an ancient Ionian Greek philosopher, polymath and the eponymous founder of Pythagoreanism. His political and religious teachings were well known in Magna Graecia and influenced the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and, through them, the West in general. Knowledge of his life is clouded by legend; modern scholars disagree regarding Pythagoras's education and influences, but they do agree that, around 530 BC, he travelled to Croton in southern Italy, where he founded a school in which initiates were sworn to secrecy and lived a communal, ascetic lifestyle. In antiquity, Pythagoras was credited with many mathematical and scientific discoveries including
            <ul>
                 <li> the Pythagorean theorem </li>
                 <li> Pythagorean tuning </li>
                 <li> the five regular solids</li>
                 <li> the Theory of Proportions</li>
                 <li> the sphericity of the Earth</li>
                 <li> the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. </li>
            </ul>
            It was said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom")[c] and that he was the first to divide the globe into five climatic zones. Classical historians debate whether Pythagoras made these discoveries, and many of the accomplishments credited to him likely originated earlier or were made by his colleagues or successors. Some accounts mention that the philosophy associated with Pythagoras was related to mathematics and that numbers were important, but it is debated to what extent, if at all, he actually contributed to mathematics or natural philosophy

            Pythagoras' Theorem is a fundamental concept in geometry that describes the relationship between the lengths of the sides of a right-angled triangle. The theorem states:
            
                <p id="equa">a² + b² = c²</p>
            
            <b>where:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>a and b are the lengths of the two sides that form the right angle (legs)</li>
                    <li>c is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b>Key Points:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>The theorem only applies to right-angled triangles.</li>
                    <li>The hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.</li>
                    <li>The theorem can be used to find the length of the hypotenuse (c) or one of the legs (a or b).</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p><b>Example:</b>
            <br>
            Find the length of the hypotenuse (c) in a right-angled triangle with legs of 3 inches (a) and 4 inches (b).
            <br>
            Solution:
            <ul style="font-size: 13px;font-family: serif;">
                <li>a² + b² = c²</li>
                <li>3² + 4² = c²</li>
                <li>9 + 16 = c²</li>
                <li>25 = c²</li>
                <li>c = √25</li>
                <li>c = 5 inches</li>
